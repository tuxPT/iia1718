## How to configure a remote (upstream) repository in git:

You probably created your own git repository to manage your project
(this is recommended).
Then, it's a good idea to configure the original professors repository 
as a remote (upstream) repository.
This will allow you to fetch any changes made in the upstream and merge them
into your branch.
To configure the remote repository, go to your local project and:

    git remote add upstream https://code.ua.pt/git/tpg-ia-iia-longlife

More info in: https://help.github.com/articles/configuring-a-remote-for-a-fork/

Now, whenever you need to incorporate changes made upstream, do:

    git fetch upstream
    git checkout master         # (or another branch, if you defined any)
    git merge upstream/master
